Assign three crew to Engine Room, one to Scanner Array, and one to Warp Control. Assign the three horses to Life Support. When hostiles appear, shift horses to Missile Control at the last minute, then shift them back when the hostiles are dead. When stellar storms appear, shift horses to shield gens when it hits. Heat wave will do nothing. Rad field will do nothing if the horses are in Life Support. Warp past the black hole when it comes. When spatial flux hits, if you don't have 15 charge, move Engine Room crew to Warp Control until you do. When spatial flux hits, move injured crew to medbay with one horse.

Your efficiency should be well above 100% during lulls, which will drop the required efficiency and buy you enough slack that you can drop efficiency low right before a crisis when you move horses out of Life Support. Once you're past the black hole and two spatial fluxes, move Warp Control crew to Scanner Array and feel free to move horses to Engine Room.
